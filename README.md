- Automatically generated canonical URL tags (to prevent duplicate content).

This article will give you some advice and suggestions for beginners that will help you improve your Shopify store's SEO and show up in searches on Google, Bing, and other search engines.

So what does all that mean? Below are some definitions of the elements of **SEO**:

**Title tags**

The title is the title tag on the top of any website to navigate the contents of the page in the most concise way for the users. For SEO, the title tag directs the Google Bot to the main content of the site and also the bold and bold line on the SERP (search results page). Therefore, if you want your website to really excel on the search page and be clicked on by users, the title must be really short and attractive.

**Meta descriptions**

The meta description tag of the page provides Google and the search engines with a summary of the content of the page. While the page title may be a few words or phrases, the description tag of the page must have one or two sentences or a short paragraph. The meta description tag is a fairly basic On page SEO element that needs to be carefully optimized.

**The image’s file names and Alt tags**

 Because the search engines can not read the images so the image’s file names and Alt tags are used to describe a picture's contents. When customers search for images, the descriptive Alt tags helps to show up your images.

**Sitemap xml file: is the map of website**

XML Sitemap for the spider when entering the index website.Bot highly appreciates the websites which have sitemap because thanks to the sitemap, the spider will index the content faster. Moreover, with Sitemap, we can navigate the spider as we want. Creating a sitemap does not mean increasing your rankings, but it helps Google better understand your website, and then rank good keywords for your site. 

**Robot txt. files**

In your website, you certainly don’t want some pages, directories, files seen by others. When a robot visits a website, before reading the content of the site, it will find a robots.txt file. This is a text file, located in the root directory, containing the command line to not allow the robot has access to some resources on the website.

**Canonical URL**

The fact that one website can have more than one URL. But Google treats each URL as one page. Then there will be duplicate content between the URLs. Google only accepts one index URL. It could be a URL you do not want. Therefore, Canonical URL helps to solve all the problem about duplicate content when there are multiple URLs have identical or very similar content so that the search engines can index exactly your preferred URL.

### 1. SEO basic

Content is the most important thing of SEO. if you want people to find your store in search engines like: Google, Bing or other search engines, you need have many words of your store page. This words should be the words customers often search them in search engines. That makes your store gets high rank in search results. You should write your content in your store, collections and your products and set this content in page title, meta description, the heading and so on 

### 2. Keyword

Keywords are the terms that people use to search for things on the web. As a store owner, you want to know what keywords your customers are using. A useful tool to help you discover the most popular keywords is the [Google Keyword Planner](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/3141229). You can use this tool to find the most popular keywords by comparing search volumes. Moreover, we focus on helping you write better content by direct analysis and suggest keywords and phrases that make the SEO process better.

 Remember that the more traffic your keyword is, the more your store will show at the top of the search, as you will have more competition.

There are 5 places where you can place the keyword:

- Page title
- Meta description
- The Heading
- Alt tags
- The page’s body content

#### Page title and Meta description

This is two important elements of on-page optimization. Page title and description of your store are always read first and that is the determined element that customers decide to visit your store or not. 

**Page title**

You should put the keywords to the left of the title and contents of title must be unique throughout the website. Keep your page title from 10 to 70 characters to display in results. The title can be set for pages, products, collections or page in Shopify.

**Meta description**

This is the text under a page title in a search result. Shopify will automatically pull text from your page but you can customize the meta description manually to match your marketing goals.

3. Click Save
 
#### The heading

It is important that you include your main keywords in the names of your store's products, pages, collections, or blog posts. For example: you want to sell a blue hat with your store’ name on it, you should set the product’s name like: Banana’s Hat - blue. This will make your page more likely to show up when people search for words like: Banana, hat and blue hat.

#### Alt tags

The image is also a component of content and it also needs to be optimized for the keyword. Google and other search engines can not read the content of the image file and it only read parts of the text. When customers search for images, the alt text will help to describe a picture’s contents and show up

#### The page’s body content

A large number of sellers make a mistake to begin that only focus on their customers or only the search engines. A success store has to focus on both. Before your customers know your store, you must make the computer understand what your text is all about. So the page’s body content is very significant with your store. It should include the keywords that you think customers search in search engines and relate your store. The more content you write in your product description, collection or blog post, your chances will be found on Google and other search engines. all content on your website should be unique and written by you and don’t use product descriptions from manufacturers to avoid duplicate content with other websites.
